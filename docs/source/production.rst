Production Usage
================

Sqlfluff is designed to be used both as a utility for developers but also to
be part of `CI/CD`_ pipelines.

Using sqlfluff on a whole sql codebase
--------------------------------------

The `exit code`_ provided by sqlfluff when run as a command line utility is
designed to assist usefulness in deployment pipelines. If no violations
are found then the `exit code`_ will be 0. If violations are found then
a non-zero code will be returned which can be interrogated to find out
more.

- At the moment all error states related to linting return *65*.
- An error as a result of a sqlfluff internal error will return *1*.

Using sqlfluff on changes using `diff-quality`
----------------------------------------------

For projects with large amounts of (potentially imperfect) SQL code, the full
SQLFluff output could be very large, which can be distracting -- perhaps the CI
build for a one-line SQL change shouldn't encourage the developer to fix lots
of unrelated quality issues.

To support this use case, SQLFluff integrates with a quality checking tool
called `diff-quality`. By running SQLFluff using `diff-quality` (rather than
running it directly), you can limit the the output to the new or modified SQL
in the branch (aka pull request or PR) containing the proposed changes.

Currently, ``diff-quality`` requires that you are using ``git`` for version
control.

NOTE: Installing SQLFluff automatically installs the `diff_cover` package that
provides the `diff-quality` tool.

Adding `diff-quality` to your builds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In your CI build script:

1. Set the current working directory to the ``git`` repository containing the
SQL code to be checked.

2. Run `diff-quality`, specifying SQLFluff as the underlying tool:

.. code-block:: bash

    diff-quality --violations sqlfluff

The output will look something like:

.. code-block:: bash

    -------------
    Diff Quality
    Quality Report: sqlfluff
    Diff: origin/master...HEAD, staged and unstaged changes
    -------------
    sql/audience_size_queries/constraints/_postcondition_check_gdpr_compliance.sql (0.0%):
    sql/audience_size_queries/constraints/_postcondition_check_gdpr_compliance.sql:5: Inconsistent capitalisation of unquoted identifiers.
    -------------
    Total:   1 line
    Violations: 1 line
    % Quality: 0%
    -------------

These messages are basically the same as those provided directly by SQLFluff,
although the format is a little different. Note that `diff-quality` only lists
the line _numbers_, not the character position. If you need the character
position, you will need to run SQLFluff directly.

For more information on `diff-quality`, see the
[documentation](https://diff-cover.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It covers topics
such as:

* Generating HTML reports
* Controlling which branch to compare against (i.e. to determine new/changed
  lines). The default is `origin/master`.
* Configuring `diff-quality` to return an error code if the quality is too low
* Troubleshooting

Using `pre-commit`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SQLFluff comes with two `pre-commit`_ hooks:

* sqlfluff-lint: returns linting errors.
* sqlfluff-fix: attempts to fix rule violations.

Running with `pre-commit`_, you get the benefit of
only linting/fixing the files that changed.

Your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` should look like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

  repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff
    rev: v0.4.0
    hooks:
      - id: sqlfluff-lint
        # For dbt projects, this installs the dbt "extras":
        # additional_dependencies: ['.[dbt]']
      - id: sqlfluff-fix
        # Fixes indentation and inconsistent capitalisation
        args: [--rules, "L003,L014"]
        # additional_dependencies: ['.[dbt]']
